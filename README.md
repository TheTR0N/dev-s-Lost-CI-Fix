This is well a Computerinterface fix i got from dev's discord when getting it off github it was from the official Developer9998 account so it's legit and i have it installed on my pc
this is Computerinterface v1.4.0 to be exact for dem nerds but yea the real deal has been deleted and nowhere to be found even on the discord, that is the WHOLE REASON I AM POSTING IT ON GITHUB
anyways enjoy the fix while you can when it breaks and you get banned i am not responsible
